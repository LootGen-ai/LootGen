## Description
This program serves as an advanced assistant to Dungeons and Dragons players and Dungeon Masters. With this program, you may run requests to have your characters evaluated by an AI assistant that will provide either suggestions about appropriate Wizards of the Coast created magical loot, or you may request that the AI create new loot for you in line with the magic item creation rules set for in the 5th Edition Dungeon Master's Guide.

## Installation Instructions
### Prerequisites
### Set Up a Virtual Environment
First, create a virtual environment in your project directory. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
> python -m venv venv
```
Activate the virtual environment:

- On Windows, use:> venv\Scripts\activate
- On macOS and Linux, use:$ source venv/bin/activate
### API dependencies
This repository does not come with API keys to the required Firebase Authentication database, the Supabase database, nor the OpenAI assistant.

In the event that the creators of this program would like you to test their work or offer you access to their edition of these dependencies, the API keys will be provided in the zip folder you receive directly.

Should you wish to use this without the authors' API keys, you will be required to set up your own Firebase authentication database, Supabase content database, and OpenAI assistant. The authors of this program may provide support in setting up the databases at their discretion.

### Install Required Libraries
Install all required external libraries by running:

```bash
> pip install flask supabase pyrebase4 firebase firebase-admin==5.0.0 openai==0.28
```
or alternatively you can install with (from the root directory):

```bash
> pip install requirements.txt
```
This command installs the required library dependencies needed to support this application.

### Running the Application
To run the application, use the following command:

```bash
> python LootGen_app.py
```
There will be a slight delay as the health check file ensures all API keys are active. Please wait for confirmation in the terminal.

Once completed, this will start the Flask server, and you should see the application running on `http://localhost:5000`.

Press Ctrl and click where it says `http://localhost:5000` to launch the application in your browser.

## Project Status and Future Roadmap
The core of LootGen has been completed as required by the initial catalyst for its creations. The ability to create an account, add characters, and request evaluation is complete. However, members of the team have expressed interest in furthering this program in order to support storage of LootGen created items, more detailed charater analysis, and monster encounter recommendations.
